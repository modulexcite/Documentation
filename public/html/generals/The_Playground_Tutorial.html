<h1><a name="the-babylonjs-playground" class="anchor" href="#the-babylonjs-playground"></a>The BabylonJS Playground!</h1><p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/playground02.jpg" alt="">
A Saved &#39;Custom&#39; Playground Scene: <a href="http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS">http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/#QKQHS</a></p>
<h2><a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"></a>What is it?</h2><p>The BabylonJS Playground is an on-line white-boarding and experimenting application... used to assist in creating scenes for the Javascript-based BabylonJS webGL framework.&nbsp; Your browser must be WebGL-ready and have Javascript active... in order to use the playground.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most modern browsers have these capabilities.</p>
<p>Briefly said, you can enter or modify Javascript-based BabylonJS scene code on the left-side &#39;editor&#39; portion of the playground, press the Run button, and the playground will attempt to render the webGL scene on the right side, using the latest version of the BabylonJS framework.</p>
<h2><a name="the-top-menu" class="anchor" href="#the-top-menu"></a>The Top Menu</h2><p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/playground_tm01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The playground&#39;s top menu currently contains 8 buttons:</p>
<p><strong>Run</strong> - The Run button is easy to understand. After you paste-in code to the editor, or after you make changes to the code in the editor, you press <strong>Run</strong>.&nbsp; This commands the playground to try to render your scene.</p>
<p><strong>Save</strong> - The Save button will cause your scene to be permanently stored in the playground&#39;s database, and it will issue a unique URL, which we will talk more about, below.&nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about accidentally overwriting any of the pre-installed demo scenes in the playground.&nbsp; That is not allowed to happen. Often, the <strong>Save</strong> button is used so that you may share the scene&#39;s URL with others, or to allow you to bookmark the saved URL in your browser, and return to continue your &#39;play&#39; at another time.</p>
<p><strong>Get .zip</strong> - The Get .zip button is a handy playground feature. If you wish to take your scene home, publish it on a web server, or hand it out to others, THIS is your button.&nbsp; <strong>Get .zip</strong> attempts to install your editor code into a single index.html file, and puts that file into a zip called sample.zip.&nbsp; Then it offers the sample.zip file to you, for downloading.&nbsp; Once downloaded and unzipped, you will see the file named index.html.&nbsp; You can browse this file with a webGL-ready browser, and your scene should render nicely in your browser.&nbsp; After you are sure that your index.html file is working properly, you may want to publish it to a web server and share your beautiful playground scene with the entire world.&nbsp; There is no need to install framework files such as babylon.js and hand.js in nearby directories, because the index.html file references the same on-line versions of the framework... as the playground itself uses.&nbsp; The index.html file is ready-to-run and completely portable.&nbsp; (We love it!)</p>
<p><strong>New</strong> - The New button is a unique and handy feature. If you look carefully at the editor code in the picture above, or if you have selected one of the pre-installed playground scenes from the drop-down scene selector, you will notice that they are &#39;wrapped&#39; in a function called &#39;createScene()&#39;.&nbsp; The createScene() function is a very common function used in many BabylonJS scenes.&nbsp; Copying and pasting createScene() functions is done often with users of the BabylonJS framework.&nbsp; By pressing this button, you will empty the contents of the editor, and a basic un-programmed createScene() function will be placed in the editor.&nbsp; A camera is provided by default, but you may want to add some light and mesh, so the new scene becomes renderable.</p>
<p><strong>Clear</strong> - The Clear button is also easy to understand. This button simply empties all the code out of the playground editor.&nbsp; It is often used in preparing for the pasting-in of a createScene() function, or in preparation for some experimenting that you are about to embark-upon.&nbsp; The BabylonJS playground is a fantastic way to create experiments using the BabylonJS framework.&nbsp; It is a wonderful way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Font size</strong> - The Font size button almost needs no explaining. This button and resulting pull-down selector allows you to adjust the font size of the code in the playground editor.</p>
<p><strong>Scene Selector</strong> - This pull-down selector button (shown as &#39;Custom&#39; in the picture above)... is used to select any of the pre-installed playground demo scenes.&nbsp; &#39;Custom&#39; is not the name of any of those demo scenes.&nbsp; The reason that it says &#39;Custom&#39; is because the scene in the editor at the time that the picture was taken... was a &#39;custom&#39; scene.&nbsp; It was a modified Basic Scene demo that I created for use in the picture.&nbsp; Often, when you first arrive at the playground site, this button will be labeled &#39;Basic Scene&#39;.&nbsp; No matter what label is currently on the button, the button is called the <strong>Scene Selector</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Fullscreen</strong> - The Fullscreen button also needs very little explaining. This button causes the right-side rendering canvas to go into fullscreen mode.&nbsp; Upon entering fullscreen mode, your browser will provide instructions about how to exit fullscreen mode and return to the playground&#39;s default split-screen mode.</p>
<h2><a name="the-editor" class="anchor" href="#the-editor"></a>The Editor</h2><p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/playground_ed02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The playground&#39;s left-side code editor is a &#39;smart&#39; editor which is based-upon <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">the Ace Editor</a>.&nbsp; The playground editor has many fantastic features.&nbsp; It uses type-ahead features such as automatically adding matched quotes, parentheses, braces, and brackets... handy things for a programming editor.&nbsp; It tries to spot programming errors, and places little icons along the left side when it sees potential syntax problems.&nbsp; If you place your mouse pointer over these little icons that sometimes appear, the editor will pop-up a small window telling you about what it has seen.&nbsp; The editor also has syntax highlighting, code-folding, text drag-and-drop, automatic indent and outdent, and a 4 million line capacity. Telling of the many features of our editor... is beyond the scope of this tutorial.&nbsp; You can learn more about the wonderful Ace Editor... with <a href="http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about">a visit to their website</a>... and by simply spending some time using the playground editor.</p>
<p><strong>oops</strong> - One of the most important features in any programmer&#39;s editor... is UNDO and REDO, and our playground editor fully supports both of these features.&nbsp; I am not familiar with the undo and redo keypresses for all OS systems, but for Windows... undo is Control-z and redo is Shift-Control-z.&nbsp; You can do multiple undo and redo, as well. This is very handy, and again, we love it.</p>
<h2><a name="the-rendering-canvas" class="anchor" href="#the-rendering-canvas"></a>The Rendering Canvas</h2><p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/playground_rc01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>What can you say about the BabylonJS webGL rendering canvas, other than &quot;IT IS THE COOLEST THING ON THE PLANET!&quot;.&nbsp; This right-side area of the playground is where the BabylonJS webGL framework attempts to render the scene that you currently have in the editor.&nbsp; Is the rendering canvas blank?&nbsp; Did you click the Run button?&nbsp; Have you got a camera?&nbsp; Is the camera aimed correctly?&nbsp; Do you have some lighting or an emissiveColor set on your mesh&#39;s material?</p>
<p>If your code is wrapped in a createScene() function, does it include <em>var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine),</em> near the top of the function?&nbsp; How about a <em>return scene;</em> line as the last line inside the function braces?&nbsp; Do you have some mesh like a box, cylinder, ground, sphere, plane, torus, torusknot, etc?</p>
<p>Are you running in free-flying mode and not wrapping your code in a createScene() function?&nbsp; That is certainly allowed, but you still need a camera, a light, and a mesh shape.&nbsp; These are a few things that can prevent your scene from rendering.&nbsp; Study the playground demo scenes listed under the drop-down Scene Selector button, and soon you will be a BabylonJS playground expert.</p>
<h2><a name="compilation-errors" class="anchor" href="#compilation-errors"></a>Compilation Errors</h2><p><img src="http://urbanproductions.com/wingy/babylon/misc/playground_ce01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a picture of the playground&#39;s pop-up compilation error detector panel.&nbsp; A compilation error is an error detected by the BabylonJS framework... after you have clicked the Run button.&nbsp; It is not a syntax error detected by the editor, but the editor might ALSO detect it and possibly mark the problem line with a red X icon along its left side. The compilation error does not always contain pertinent information about the reason for the error, yet it is still handy.&nbsp; It tells you that the BabylonJS framework is not happy with something in your scene code.&nbsp; After making an adjustment to your code, you will want to close the compilation error pop-up (using its X closer) before clicking on Run again.</p>
<h2><a name="playground-url-formats" class="anchor" href="#playground-url-formats"></a>Playground URL formats</h2><p>When you first arrive at the BabylonJS playground web site, the URL in your browser&#39;s address field... will look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/</a></p>
<p>If you choose one of the demo scenes from the drop-down Scene Selector button, the playground URL will change to this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#</a></p>
<p>(Feel free to edit the code of the demo scenes and click Run or Save. You can&#39;t damage the pre-installed demos)</p>
<p>When you save a scene to the playground&#39;s database in order to share the URL with others or remember the scene for later, the URL will look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS</a></p>
<p>(Be sure to bookmark it, using your browser&#39;s bookmark system)</p>
<p>If you save that scene again... (maybe after doing more work on the scene), the URL will increment, and look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS#1">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS#1</a></p>
<p>If you save that scene again... the URL will increment, and look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS#2">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/#QKQHS#2</a></p>
<p>(Again, be sure to bookmark this URL so you can easily return to it later)</p>
<p>And lastly, if you want to load a specific pre-installed demo scene, such as the #12 Particles demo, you can use a URL that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/?12">http://www.babylonjs.com/playground/?12</a></p>
<h3><a name="maintaining-your-focus" class="anchor" href="#maintaining-your-focus"></a>Maintaining Your Focus</h3><p>Sometimes you will run a scene and use your cursor keys and mouse in the rendering canvas, and then want to &#39;focus&#39; back to the editor... to make some more code changes.&nbsp; Sometimes, you will need to mouse-click somewhere in the editor area... to give the editor focus again.&nbsp; Once the editor has focus, your cursor keys will, once again, move the editor&#39;s cursor.&nbsp; This happens most often when a Babylon FreeCamera is the active camera.</p>
<h3><a name="and-that39s-a-wrap" class="anchor" href="#and-thats-a-wrap"></a>And... That&#39;s A Wrap</h3><p>Hey, thanks for reading this tutorial and for discovering the BabylonJS playground.&nbsp; We are very proud of it, and we think you will enjoy using it.&nbsp; This tutorial is still quite new, and will likely be changing often.&nbsp; Be sure to check back for updates and future features.</p>
