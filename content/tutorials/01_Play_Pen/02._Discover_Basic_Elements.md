## Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to create basic elements using Babylon.js, such as boxes, spheres, and planes.

[**Playground Demo Scene 2 - Seven basic shapes/mesh**](http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/?2)

## How can I do this ?
An easy way to get started using basic elements... is by visiting [**Playground Demo Scene 02**](http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/?2).  You might wish to use the 'Get .zip' choice on its top menu.  The index.html that you will receive in that zip... contains everything you will need to start making basic elements.  Remember that link, as we will talk more about it.

I'm sure you have already read the  [**Babylon.js Primer**](http://doc.babylonjs.com/page.php?p=22621) and the  [**previous tutorial**](http://doc.babylonjs.com/page.php?p=21911), and thus you know how to format scene files.  So, we won't talk about that, here.  We are going to go step by step through [**Playground Demo Scene 02**](http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/?2).  Open that link in a new tab or window, and then come back here, and we'll get started.

Let's look at the createScene function used in Playground Demo 2:

```javascript

    var createScene = function () {
        var scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);
    
        var camera = new BABYLON.ArcRotateCamera("Camera", 3 * Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 8, 50, BABYLON.Vector3.Zero(), scene);
    
        camera.attachControl(canvas, false);
    
        var light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight("hemi", new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);
    
        //Creation of a box
        //(name of the box, size, scene)
        var box = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox("box", 6.0, scene);
    
        //Creation of a sphere 
        //(name of the sphere, segments, diameter, scene) 
        var sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere("sphere", 10.0, 10.0, scene);
    
        //Creation of a plane
        //(name of the plane, size, scene)
        var plane = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePlane("plane", 10.0, scene);
    
        //Creation of a cylinder
        //(name, height, diamTop, diamBottom, tessellation, [optional height subdivs], scene, updatable)
        var cylinder = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateCylinder("cylinder", 3, 3, 3, 6, 1, scene, false);
    
        // Creation of a torus
        // (name, diameter, thickness, tessellation, scene, updatable)
        var torus = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorus("torus", 5, 1, 10, scene, false);
    
        // Creation of a knot
        // (name, radius, tube, radialSegments, tubularSegments, p, q, scene, updatable)
        var knot = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorusKnot("knot", 2, 0.5, 128, 64, 2, 3, scene);
    
        // Creation of a lines mesh
        var lines = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateLines("lines", [
            new BABYLON.Vector3(-10, 0, 0),
            new BABYLON.Vector3(10, 0, 0),
            new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, -10),
            new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 10)
        ], scene);
    
        // Moving elements
        box.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(-10, 0, 0);   // Using a vector
        sphere.position = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 10, 0); // Using a vector
        plane.position.z = 10;                  // Using a single coordinate component
        cylinder.position.z = -10;
        torus.position.x = 10;
        knot.position.y = -10;
    
        return scene;
    }
```
Starting with the box, we create 7 different basic elements, and then position them at the end of the function (to keep them from being atop one another).  It's really quite easy, isn't it?  Again, starting with the creation of the box, let's talk about each of the 7 shapes/meshes.  

* **Creation of a Box**
```javascript
var box = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox("box", 6.0, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```
Parameters are: name, size of the box, the scene to attach the mesh, updatable? (if the mesh must be modified later) and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var box = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateBox("box", 6.0, scene);
```

* **Creation of a Sphere**
```javascript
var sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere("sphere", 10.0, 10.0, scene, false,  BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```
Parameters are: name, number of segments (highly detailed or not), size, scene to attach the mesh, updatable? (if the mesh must be modified later) and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere("sphere", 10.0, 10.0, scene);
```
Beware to adapt the number of segments to the size of your mesh ;)

* **Creation of a Plane**

```javascript
var plane = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePlane("plane", 10.0, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```

Parameters are: name, size, and scene to attach the mesh, updatable? (if the mesh must be modified later) and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var plane = BABYLON.Mesh.CreatePlane("plane", 10.0, scene);
```
* **Creation of a Disc (or a regular polygon)**
```javascript
var disc = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateDisc("disc", 5, 30, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```
Parameters are: name, radius, tessellation, scene, updatable and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var disc = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateDisc("disc", 5, 30, scene);
```
With the  _tessellation_ value, you can get a regular polygon :  
3 gives a triangle,  
4 a square,  
5 a pentagon,  
6 a hexagon, 7 a heptagon, 8 an octogon, and so on.

* **Creation of a Cylinder**

```javascript
var cylinder = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateCylinder("cylinder", 3, 3, 3, 6, 1, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```

Parameters are: name, height, diamTop, diamBottom, tessellation, [height subdivs], scene, updatable and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var cylinder = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateCylinder("cylinder", 3, 3, 3, 6, 1, scene);
```
The _height subdivs_ parameter (shown set to 1) is optional too.

* **Creation of a Torus**

```javascript
var torus = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorus("torus", 5, 1, 10, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```
Parameters are: name, diameter, thickness, tessellation (highly detailed or not), scene, updatable and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var torus = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorus("torus", 5, 1, 10, scene);
```

* **Creation of a Knot**

```javascript
var knot = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorusKnot("knot", 2, 0.5, 128, 64, 2, 3, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```
Parameters are: name, radius, tube, radialSegments, tubularSegments, p, q, scene, updatable and the optional side orientation (see below). These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var knot = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTorusKnot("knot", 2, 0.5, 128, 64, 2, 3, scene);
```
You can learn more about torus knots... [**RIGHT HERE**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot).

* **Creation of a Lines Mesh**

```javascript
var lines = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateLines("lines", [
    new BABYLON.Vector3(-10, 0, 0),
    new BABYLON.Vector3(10, 0, 0),
    new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, -10),
    new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 10)
], scene);
```
Parameters are: name, [array of comma-separated vectors], scene. 

I could explain how the Lines Mesh constructor works, but I think you can see how it works just by looking at the demo code above.  Notice the [ and ].  Those are the enclosing tokens for an array, yet another kind of Javascript value.  The first vector3 of the array is the starting location for drawing lines.  After that, a comma, and then the next vector3 location... indicating where the line is drawing-to next.  Then, another comma, and another vector3 to a new location.  You can add as many vectors as you wish, but notice that the LAST vector3 does not have a comma following it.  Please make your array of vectors be formatted similarly.    

* **Creation of DashedLines Mesh**

```javascript
var dashedlines = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateDashedLines("dashedLines", [v1, v2, ... vn], dashSize, gapSize, dashNb, scene);
```
Parameters are : name, [array of Vectors3], dashSize, gapSize, dashNumber, scene.    
As for Lines, a line along the vectors3 will be displayed in space. It will try to set _dashNumber_ strokes on this line depending on the length of each segment between two successive vectors3.    
_dashSize_ and _gapSize_ are relative to each other dash and gap sizes within these strokes.   

* **Creation of a Ribbon**

What is a ribbon ?  
Imagine a first series of successive points defining a path.  
Now get another series of successive points, so another path.  
If you construct then triangular faces by joining alternately each point of the first and the second path like when you lace shoes, you get a ribbon.  
Your paths don't need to be parallel. They don't even need to be straight lines or in the same plane.  
They are, well, what you want. The ribbon will just follow your paths.  

Now, imagine, instead of having only two paths, you've got many successive different paths.  
The full ribbon will then be the continuous surface joining all these inbetween pair of paths surface.

```javascript
var ribbon = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateRibbon("ribbon", [path1, path2, ..., pathn], false, false, 0, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);
```

Parameters are: name, pathArray, closeArray, closePath, offset, scene, updatable? (if the mesh must be modified later)  and the optional side orientation (see below).


  * name : a string, the name you want to give to your shape,
  * pathArray : an array populated with paths. Paths are also arrays, populated with series of successive _Vector3_. You need at least one path to construct a ribbon and each path must contain at least four _Vector3_,
  * closeArray : boolean, if true an extra set of triangles is constructed between the last path and the first path of _pathArray_,
  * closePath : boolean, if true the last point of each path of _pathArray_ is joined to the first point of this path,
  * offset : integer (default half the _path_ size) mandatory only if the _pathArray_ contents only one path. The ribbon will be constructed joining each i-th point of the single path to the i+offset-th point. It is ignored if _pathArray_ has got more than one path,
  * scene : the current scene,
  * updatable : if the ribbon should updated later
  * sideOrientation : the wanted side orientation (front, back or double side).

These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var ribbon = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateRibbon("ribbon", [path1, path2, ..., pathn], false, false, 0, scene);
```

I you need more details about how to deal with this method, you would probably read the [**Parametric Shapes**]() part.

* ** Creation of a Tube**

```javascript
var tube = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTube("tube", [V1, V2, ..., Vn], radius, tesselation, radiusFunction, cap, scene, false, BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULTSIDE);

```
Parameters are : name, path, radius, tesselation, optional radiusFunction, cap, scene, updatable, sideOrientation.

  * name : string, the name of the tube mesh,
  * path : an array of successive Vector3, at least two Vector3,
  * radius : the tube radius, taken into account when _radiusFunction_ parameter set to _null_,
  * tesselation : the number of radial segments,
  * radiusFunction : _optional_, a javascript function returning a radius value, can be let to _null_,
  * cap : BABYLON.Mesh.NO_CAP, BABYLON.Mesh.CAP_START, BABYLON.Mesh.CAP_END, BABYLON.Mesh.CAP_ALL,  
  * updatable : if the tube could be updated later,
  * sideOrientation : the wanted side orientation (front, back or double side).

These two last parameters can be omitted if you just need the default behavior :
```javascript
var tube = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTube("tube", [V1, V2, ..., Vn], radius, tesselation, radiusFunction, cap, scene);
```
The tube can be used also as a [**Parametric Shapes**]() by setting a radius function.



#### Updatable
This parameter present in each mesh creation method tells if the mesh could be updated once it is created.  
If false (default value), the mesh data are passed only once to the GPU.  
If true, the mesh data may be recomputed and passed to the GPU at each frame refresh.  

#### Side Orientation
When a mesh is created, a side orientation is given to it.  
The side orientation is used to give visibility and/or light reflection to each side of the mesh.  
There are four possible values for this parameter :  

  * BABYLON.Mesh.FRONTSIDE,
  * BABYLON.Mesh.BACKSIDE,
  * BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE,
  * BABYLON.Mesh.DEFAULT which is the default value and equals FRONTSIDE currently.

This parameter is optional. If not given, the DEFAULT value is set.  

*(We assume the backFaceCulling is enabled by default)*  

For instance, imagine you create a basic shape like a box, a sphere or a plane and you don't give it a material.   
If you go behind the plane or inside the box or the sphere, you can check that the faces aren't visible any longer : this meshes are constructed with the default side orientation _FRONTSIDE_. This means each side is only a front view.  
test it : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#14RNAU#4  
If you give your former mesh a material and light it up, you can then check the back (or internal) face is now visible, but it doesn't reflect the light. Same reason : the default side orientation is still _FRONTSIDE_.  
*(you can disable _backFaceCulling_ with this _sideOrientation_ value)*

Now just change the _sideOrientation_ parameter to _BABYLON.Mesh.BACKSIDE_.   
As you can then check, you can now only see either the back of the plane or the inside of the box or the sphere.  
test it : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#14RNAU#5  
If you give your mesh some material, you can then check the light now only reflects on the back face (plane) or only inside (box, sphere, etc).  
*(you can disable _backFaceCulling_ with this _sideOrientation_ value)*


At last, change the _sideOrientation_ parameter to _BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE_.  
As you guess, now the mesh faces are visible both sides. And if you give it a material, the light then reflects both sides too.  
test it : http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#14RNAU#6   
So why not always use _BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE_ by default ?  
Because this value creates twice more vertices than the mesh needs to be rendered with only one side. In other terms, your mesh will be twice heavier.  
*(you shouldn't disable _backFaceCulling_ with _BABYLON.Mesh.DOUBLESIDE_ value)*



### More Basic Elements - Grounds
Up to this point, we have been talking about basic elements from our [**Playground Demo Scene 02**](http://babylonjs-playground.azurewebsites.net/?2), but three important mesh shapes (basic elements) are not included in that demo scene.  They are each ways of making 'ground' in Babylon.js.  Let's take a look: 

* **Creation of a Ground**

```javascript
var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGround("ground", 6, 6, 2, scene);
```

Parameters are: name, width, depth, subdivs, scene

Our [**Playground Demo Scene 01**](http://www.babylonjs-playground.com/?1) uses a CreateGround constructor... so you can see one in action by using the above link.

* **Creation of a Ground From HeightMap**

```javascript
var ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGroundFromHeightMap("ground", "heightmap.jpg", 200, 200, 250, 0, 10, scene, false, successCallback);
```
Parameters are: name, heightmapPath, width, depth, subdivs, minheight, maxheight, scene, updatable, successCallback

HeightMap grounds are easy, but we decided to create a separate tutorial so we could say more about this important Babylon.js feature. Please see our [**HeightMap Tutorial**](http://doc.babylonjs.com/page.php?p=22141) to learn all about heightMap grounds.

* **Create of a Tiled Ground**

Thanks to forum user Kostar111 for this handy Tiled Ground constructor. Here is the basic code needed to create a tiled ground.

```javascript

var precision = {
    "w" : 2,
    "h" : 2
};
var subdivisions = {
    'h' : 8,
    'w' : 8
};
var tiledGround = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateTiledGround("Tiled Ground", -3, -3, 3, 3, subdivisions, precision, scene, false);
```

Parameters are: name, xmin, zmin, xmax, zmax, subdivisions = the number of tiles. (subdivisions.w : in width; subdivisions.h: in height), precision = the number of subdivisions inside a tile. (precision.w : in width; precision.h: in height), scene, updatable.

Kostar111 was also kind enough to give us a fine tutorial about how to use tiled grounds. [**Click right here**](http://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/how-to-use-multimaterials-with-a-tiled-ground-in-babylonjs) to view it. At that link, Kostar111 thoroughly explains how the tiled ground works, and also provides some Babylon.js Playground scenes that nicely demonstrate some of its many uses.

## Wrapping Up ##
And that’s it! Now you have seen all of our basic elements, and some ways to use them. Keep watching this area of the tutorial for new basic elements, as they are being added quite quickly. Feel free to imagine a few of your own basic element ideas, and present them on the forum. Help us make our list of basic elements grow, if you can.

## Next step ##
----
We saw that we needed a bit of 'positioning' to keep our basic elements from sitting atop one another in the scene. Now let's learn more about positions (sometimes called translations) as well as about rotation and scaling. Ready? Sure you are!
